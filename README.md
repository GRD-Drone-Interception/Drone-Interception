# Drone-Interception

## Overview
A single player drone simulation game where the player customises drones and creates their own drone scenarios, which can then be run and observed with the ability to change the formation of your drones in flight. 
We are striking a fine balance between gamification and simulation, and the systems must be able to represent complex real-world data in a way which is digestible for a wider audience rather than just experts in the field.

## How To Play
- 1 ) Customise your drones in the drone workshop. The interceptors will be the drones utilised by the defending side, and the others will used by the attacking side. Augments will affect various drone parameters such as speed, acceleration, and weight, as well as what behaviours the drones will have. 
- 2 ) Pick one of the scenarios from the workshop scenarios board
- 3 ) Upon loading a scenario, place the waypoints the attackers will use to attack various targets around the level. Use R and T keys to adjust the elevation. Attacking drones will travel to waypoints in the order they were placed. 
- 4 ) Once waypoints have been placed, place your defending and attacking drones. Each side have their respective spawning areas. 
- 5 ) When drones have been positioned and waypoints placed, hit the commence battle button.
- 6 ) The simulation now begins. Attackers will navigate between the waypoint targets, and if they are within range of the defending drones then the defenders will attack them. 
- 7 ) Once a side has lost all their units, a post analytic display will appear detailing starting units for each side as well as any losses suffered by either side. 
- 8 ) Proceding completion of a scenario, the user can naviate back to the workshop to re-customise their drones and load up a new scenario. Data from the last match will now display on the workshop stats board.
